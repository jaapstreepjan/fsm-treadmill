## Goals
As student embedded systems engineers, understanding the concept of finite state machines is important because they provide a conceptual framework for modeling and designing the behavior of digital systems. Finite state machines are used to design and implement the control logic of many different types of systems, including everything from simple home appliances to complex industrial control systems. By understanding the principles of finite state machines, we can develop more effective and efficient control systems for a wide range of applications. Additionally, understanding finite state machines can help us better analyze and troubleshoot problems that may arise in existing control systems, and it can provide a foundation for learning more advanced topics in control engineering.

## State Chart
This UML code describes a state chart for a treadmill machine. It shows the different states the machine can be in, and the events that can trigger a transition between states. For example, when the machine is turned on, it goes into the S_INIT state. If the user then starts the machine, it transitions to the S_STANDBY state. From there, the user can either start running, which takes the machine to the S_DEFAULT state, or enter diagnostics mode, which takes it to the S_DIAGNOSTICS state.

Each state is described by a set of actions that the machine performs while in that state. For example, in the S_DEFAULT state, the machine applies a brake to the degree of tilt and applies a constant power to the speed motor. It also allows changes to the tilt and speed to be made.

Overall, this state chart describes the behavior of a treadmill machine and the different actions it can perform based on user input and other events.

## State Architecture
The UML diagram describes a layered architecture for a treadmill. The layers are:
 - User Interface Layer (UI): This layer contains the screen and buttons that allow the user to interact with the treadmill.
 - System Control Layer (SCL): This layer contains a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the behavior of the treadmill based on user inputs and sensor readings.
 - Subsystems Layer (SL): This layer contains the subsystems that make up the treadmill, such as the band speed motor, incline motor, and emergency brake.
 - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): This layer provides an abstracted interface to the hardware, such as the hardware IO.

The FSM in the SCL layer communicates with the subsystems in the SL layer, and the subsystems in turn communicate with the hardware IO in the HAL layer. The screen and buttons in the UI layer also communicate with the hardware IO in the HAL layer.
